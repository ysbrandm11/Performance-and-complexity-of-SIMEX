# Performance-and-complexity-of-SIMEX
This repository is made in addition to my thesis for the double bachelor project for computer science and mathematics. The code foccuses on the simex algorithm and its complexity and performance for different parameter choices. For a better understanding of the SIMEX algorithm see the thesis.
